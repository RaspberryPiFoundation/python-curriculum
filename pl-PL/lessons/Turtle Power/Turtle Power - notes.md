#Introduction:
This project teaches Python `for` loops, through the use of the Python turtle module. Shapes are drawn using the turtle, and then loops are demonstrated as a way of drawing shapes more efficiently.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

You can find a completed version of this project's challenges by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ DrawingShapes-square.py
+ DrawingShapes-triangle.py
+ LoopyShapes.py
+ DrawingPatterns.py
+ VariablesAndShapes.py

Make sure that each child has read and write access to their own copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ Python 'turtle' module
+ `for` loops

#Challenges
+ Drawing shapes - use of the turtle commands to draw shapes.
+ Loopy shapes - using loops to efficiently draw geometric shapes.
+ Drawing patterns - using loops to draw complex patterns.
+ Variables and loops - using calculations and variables in drawing geometric shapes.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Depending on where the file is saved, naming a program 'turtle.py' can cause problems, as it clashes with the turtle module, which is also called 'turtle.py'.
+ There can sometimes be problems when trying to close the turtle drawing canvas. The line `done()` at the end of each program should help, but if the window freezes you can close the shell window, which should terminate the program.
