#Lesson One: Totally Turtles

__Introduction:__
This term we're going to be learning a computer programming language called Python. Python was named after the Monty Python’s Flying Circus TV show. Python is used by loads of programmers for many differnt things.  Python is a powerful and clever language, used at YouTube, NASA, Cern and others. If your club has a raspberry pi, you can use python to program it. Many people love python because it is easy to read (at least compared to some other programming languages). Being able to read code is a very important skill.

##Step 0: Installing Python. 

If python is already installed, skip to step 1.

Unless your computer is an Apple Mac, chances are you will have to install python.

You can download the latest version of Python from [http://www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/getit/). The exact version doesn't really matter but we're using python 3, so it should start with 3 (not 2).

##Step 1: Hello, World!

Open IDLE, the editor that comes with python. All our code will be written in this editor. 

To make a new program, open IDLE and choose File -> New Window. An empty window will appear, with '*Untitled*' in the menu bar. Enter the following code into the new  window:

```python
print("Hello, World")
```

Now, choose File -> Save. When prompted for a filename, enter hello.py, and save the file to your desktop. Then choose Run -> Run Module.

Congrats on your first python program :D
(PS! You can tell it to print anythng you like)

__ProTip__: 
* On __Windows__ and __Ubuntu__, use ctrl-N to create a new shell window, use ctrl-S to save your file after you’ve finished editing, and press F5 to run your program.
* On __Mac OS X__, cmd-N to create a new shell window, cmd-S to save your file, and hold down the function (fn) key and press F5 to run your program.

##step 2: Turtles

Next, we're going to have some fun with turtles. 

Open a new shell window and write:

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(100)
 
```
Save your program as totallyturtles.py and choose run -> new module. See how the turtle moved forward 100 pixles? 

__ProTip:__ Python program files should always be given a name ending in '.py'.

Let's make the turtle move around the canvas! Try using backward(distance) as well as turning the turtle by using right(angle) and left(angle). Eg `backward(20)` tells the turtle to move backwards 20 pixels, and `right(90)` tells the turtle to turn right 90 degrees. You can give more than one instruction at a time, they will be executed in order.

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(100)
right(120)
forward(100)
left(90)
backward(100)
left(90)
forward(50)
 
```

Play around a bit writing your own instructions.

###What does the code at the beginning of our program do?
* `from turtle import *` means we are using a python module, some code that other people have made rather than making everything over again
* `speed()` sets the speed of the turtle, it takes a value between 0 and 10. 10 is the fastest, 1 is the slowest. Speed = 0 means that no animation takes place.
* `shape()` We are using the "turtle" shape, but it can also take the values "arrow", "circle", "square", "triangle" or "classic".
We will be putting these three instructions at the top of all our programs in this lesson.

##Step 3: Drawing a Square

Lets make a square by telling the turtle how to move.

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
```
Save your program and choose run -> new module. Do you see a square?

##Step 4: Repeating Yourself (a for loop)

That last program had a lot of repeated instructions! We could draw a square through a for loop instead to save some time, yay.

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

for count in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)
```

Save your program and choose run -> new module.

You should have encountered *iteration* in Scratch before using the `Forever` and `Repeat`/`Repeat until` blocks. In python __for loops__ are used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat n number of times. In this case we want to repeat the code (that is indented) 4 times (because a square has 4 sides). 

##Step 5:Triangles, Squares and Hexagons, Oh My! (simple functions)

In python it is very easy to make your own commands, hurrah! We can define our very own *function* using `def`. Let's name this function __square__ as it is for making squares. We like it when things do what they say.

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

def square():
    for count in range(4):
        forward(100)
        right(90)

square()
```
inside the *body* of our function we put the code we wrote for making a square. The *body* goes on the next line after the one starting with `def`. Remember to indent the code. Now whenever we want to make a square we just write `square()`. Easy!

Save your program and choose run -> new module.

### Making a better function

But what if we want to be able to easily make squares of varying sizes, not just 100 pixel squared ones? Let's improve our function by adding a *parameter* `length` to it. 

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

def square(length):
    for count in range(4):
        forward(length)
        right(90)

square(100)
```
Save your program and choose run -> new module.

Now if we want to make squares of different sizes, we just pass a different length to the function when we call it. Why don't you try out a few different ones like `square(50)` and `square(200)`.

### Challenge: Drawing other geometric shapes

can you draw 

* a triangle? (three sides)
* a pentagon? (five sides)
* a hexagon? (six sides)
* an octagon? (eight sides)

### Challenge: Can you write a function that works out the angle?

```pyhton
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

def shape(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides
    for count in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)

shape(23, 5)
```
##Step 6:Drawing A Robot

* Can you draw a robot like this one [insert pic]

* Draw your own robot
