#Introduction:
This project teaches students how to run a simple Python program, and how to print text to the screen. Students will write a program to print ASCII art to the screen.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

Students can also make use of the materials which accompany these challenges.Files included in this project's Resources folder (found under the 'Download Project Materials' link):

+ AboutMe.py

Make sure that each student has read and write access to their own copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ Running a Python program;
+ Dealing with syntax errors;
+ Printing text.

#Challenges
+ What’s on your mind? - using the print() function;
+ About yourself - multiple-line text strings.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Students should make sure they type `.py` at the end of their filename when saving. This allows IDLE to use syntax highlighting, which improves code readability.
+ Students will not yet have learnt about the backslash escape character `\`. This means that students will get an error message if they try and use a backslash immediately before the end speechmark in their `print()` statement. This problem can be solved by putting a space between a backslash and any speech marks.
+ Students should not use the speech mark character `"` anywhere within a print statement, as the editor will incorrectly assume that this marks the end of the printed text.
