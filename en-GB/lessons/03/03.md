# Lesson Three: Secret Codes

Put your turtles away, today we're going to learn how to send secret messages!

## The Code Club Cipher

A cipher is a type of secret code, where you swap the letters around so no-one can read your message. We'll be doing one of the oldest and most famous ciphers, the Caesar Code. Named after a famous person, not Dog food.

We start by drawing the letters in a circle.

```
                 Z    A 
             Y            B
         X                    C
                        
      W                           D
                        
    V                               E

  U                                   F
                        
 T                                     G
     
  S                                   H
      
     R                              I

        Q                        J
           P                  K
              O           L
                 N    M
```

To make a secret letter from a normal one, we need to have a secret key.
I like the number 3, it's a magic number, so we'll use that.

```
A + 3 = D
T + 3 = W
Z + 3 = 3
```

We start at A, and count forward 3 letters: B, C, D. So the letter A turns into the letter D.
To decode, we do the same thing, but in reverse. We start at D and count backwards to get A.


## Task One: Encoding a Letter

First we'll have to tell python the alphabet. Open up IDLE, create and save a new file
with the following code.

```python
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

print len(alphabet)
```

When you run it (from the menu), it should print 26. Make sure you've got all the letters in, or your secret code won't work.

If you're happy with your alphabet, we can start to encode a letter. 

## Task Two: Encoding

Like on the wheel above, we find the position of the letter, we count forwards, and then use the letter we end up at. We do this in python
we're now at.

```python
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

letter = "a"
secret = 3

position = alphabet.find(letter)

newposition = (position + secret)

if newposition >= 26: 
    newposition = newposition - 26

secretletter = alphabet[newposition]

print secretletter
```

We look up where "a" occurs in the alphabet, add the secret number to count forwards, check to see if we've gone too far,
and then look up the letter again. Let's look at the code again, but take it slowly.
```python
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

# alphabet is the name for the text of a to z

letter = "a"
secret = 3

# the letter and secret we'll use to encode it

position = alphabet.find(letter)

# find the position of the letter, but python will tell us a number from 0 to 25

newposition = (position + secret)

# we count forward a few letters

if newposition >= 26: 
    newposition = newposition - 26

# if we count too far, we'll have to start from the beginning

secretletter = alphabet[newposition]

# now we look up the letter at this new position

print secretletter

# and output it to the screen
```

There is a lot of python going on here, so don't worry if it seems a bit too much to understand at first.

## Task Three: Uncovering the letters 
```python
secret =17
secretletter = "r"

newposition = alphabet.find(secretletter)

newposition = newposition - secret

if newposition < 0:
    newposition = newposition + 26

letter = alphabet[newposition]
```

Now we can wrap these bits of codes in functions. Take the first code and make it a function `encode`, and the second one in `decode`. 

Copy and paste the earlier code into a new file, and edit it to look like this:

```python
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

def encode(letter, secret):
    position = alphabet.find(letter)

    newposition = (position + secret)

    if newposition >= 26: 
        newposition = newposition - 26

    return alphabet[newposition]



def decode(letter, secret):
    position = alphabet.find(letter)

    newposition = (position - secret)

    if newposition >= 26: 
        newposition = newposition - 26

    return alphabet[newposition]
    
print encode("a", 17)
print decode("r", 17)
```


## Sending a Secret Word or two, and back again

Now we have some functions, let's use them to encode words. What we're going to do is go through each letter in the word, and encode
it if it's in the alphabet (so we skip spaces and punctuation)

Underneath the new functions, write the following code. Remember the `,` at the end of the print command.

```python

secret = 17
message = "hello world"

for character in message:
    if character in alphabet:
        print encode(character, secret),
    else:
        print character,


secret = 17
message = "yvccf nficu"

for character in message:
    if character in alphabet:
        print encode(character, secret),
    else:
        print character,
```
