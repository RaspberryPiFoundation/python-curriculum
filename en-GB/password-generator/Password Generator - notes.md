#Introduction:

In this project, children will learn what makes a good password, and how to make a program that creates randomly generated passwords.

This project has been written for Safer Internet Day 2017, which is on 7th February 2017. The aim of Safer Internet Day is to promote the safe and responsible use of technology for young people.

+ "Using numbers and punctuation" - adding text to a string variable, giving a wider choice of random characters.
+ "A longer password" - modifying the number of times a random character is chosen.
