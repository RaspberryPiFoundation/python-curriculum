title: Robotrumps — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. A group of children can each pick a turtle, the one that gets the furthest is the winner. 

#Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Robotrumps' starting point -- jumpto.cc/robotrumps-go](http://jumpto.cc/robotrumps-go)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ [‘Robotrumps’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9ccc368bd5](https://trinket.io/python/9ccc368bd5)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ robotrumps/robotrumps.py
+ robotrumps/cards.txt
+ Several robot .gif images

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ robotrumps-finished/robotrumps.py
+ robotrumps-finished/cards.txt
+ Several robot .gif images

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ Consolidation: data structures, reading from file and turtle graphics;
+ Using images in turtle graphics;
+ Sharing trinket projects.

#Challenges
+ Add more robots - Editing a .txt file and working with images;
+ Add more stats to the robots - handling data;
+ Play Robotrumps with a friend.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ __Offline Python does not work with .png images. .gif images have been supplied for offline use.__
+ Note that this project uses both text input and turtle graphics, you can adjust the amount of space given to each in trinket. 
+ You need to click in the trinket text window before typing. 
+ Children can use the 'Share' option in trinket to get a link to their project. If they have access to email then they can email the link to a friend, otherwise they can just read it out, note it down on a piece of paper or save it in a text file on the local network.
