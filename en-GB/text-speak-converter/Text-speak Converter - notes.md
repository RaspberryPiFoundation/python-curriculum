#Learning Objectives
+ Using dictionaries to store and retrieve data;
+ Removing dictionary data using the (`del`) method.

#Challenges
+ Adding translations - manipulating and using dictionaries;
+ Testing your program - making the program more robust;
+ Distant planets - applying the use of dictionaries to a new problem;
+ Password protection - combining dictionaries with previously learnt concepts.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Children may need to be reminded that dictionary keys and associated data are separated by a colon, that dictionary items are separated by a comma, and that there is no comma after the last item in a dictionary.
