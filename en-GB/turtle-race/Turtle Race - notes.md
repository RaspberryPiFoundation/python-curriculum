title: Turtle Race — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. A group of children can each pick a turtle, the one that gets the furthest is the winner. 

#Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Turtle Race' starting point -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ [‘Turtle Race’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9339862606](https://trinket.io/python/9339862606)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ turtle-race/turtle-race.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ turtle-race-finished/turtle-race.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ For loops;
+ Random;
+ Python turtle graphics

#Challenges
+ More lines - changing the number of times a loop repeats;
+ Race times - adding more turtles, includes adding code inside a loop;
+ Do a twirl - make turtles spin round at the start by writing new for loops;
+ Dashed lines - change solid lines into dashed lines, requires a nested loop.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Children may need reminding about the colon ':' at the end of a `for`, it's easy to omit. 
+ Incorrect indentation is a common problem when writing loops.
