#Introduction:
This project teaches children how to use variables within a Python program, and how to perform calculations on data stored in variables. This is achieved through writing a program to calculate what a person’s age will be in the year 2025.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

You can find a completed version of this project's challenges by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ TheYear3000.py
+ AgeInDogYears.py

#Learning Objectives
+ Data types;
+ Numbers and calculations;
+ Variables;
+ Text input using `input()`;
+ Casting (string → integer) using `int()`.

#Challenges
+ Pocket money - expressions using numbers;
+ Changing dates - altering data used in the calculations;
+ The year 3000! - Adding a variable to a program;
+ Your age in dog years - applying the use of variables to a new problem.

#Frequently Asked Questions
There are 2 different ways of printing numbers:

+ By passing numbers as separate parameters to the `print()` function, for example:

```python
print("I am", 11, "years old")
```

In this case, a space is added between each parameter.

+ By casting the number to text with the `str()` function and then adding it to another text string, for example:

```python
print("I am " + str(11) + " years old")
```

In this case, spaces neeed to be added.
